This is a introductory project to machine learning. From a CTG database a linear regression model was used to attempt to predict the health of a fetus. The resault are classified as 1=healthy, 2=suspect, 3=pathological. The data was scaled, centered and split into a training set and a testing set, before predictions were made. As the resaults show the model does a great job at identifying healthy and pathological fetuses, however there is improvment to be made with identifying the suspect cases. More work will be done and other methods will be implemented to improve this.
Made in collaboration with Gustav Lokna.
